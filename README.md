# Blind OSU
The idea is to create a game which supports blind game without any loss of the original gameplay (with sight). Designed to be played on mobile. Currently in development for a iOS, but I hope to bring this to all platforms. 

## The Game
The objective of the game is to tap a point on a screen based on song input. Any song from youtube can be used to generate a level based on user input. For each successful 'tap' on the phone screen, the user gains a point. Think of this as a sort of inverted OSU, where the player takes a sound and taps based on the output of that sound.

## Status
The gameplay and math for the first part of the backend is done. Songs can be donwloaded, and a level can be generated from an arbitrary song, however, the frontend (swift app) is still in development. I have gotten the stages to work, I just need to figure out a way to get the music to play from a base64 url.
